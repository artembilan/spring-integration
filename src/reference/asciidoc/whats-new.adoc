==== Core Changes

===== Gateway Changes

The gateway now correctly sets the `errorChannel` header when the gateway method has a `void` return type and an error channel is provided.
Previously, the header was not populated.
This had the effect that synchronous downstream flows (running on the calling thread) would send the exception to the configured channel but an exception on an async downstream flow would be sent to the default `errorChannel` instead.
